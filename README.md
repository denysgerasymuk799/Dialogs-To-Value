 people with whom and when communicate the most for each dialog).
2.	sentiment of messages. 
3.	tracking time and day when you get positive response from special person, so you can better know in what time write for special person to get positive response.
4.	finding the main topics of each subdialog in each chat


**Technologies**: Python, Pandas, Numpy, Plotly.

3. in console input: import nltk; nltk.download()
4. install (or update) NLP-Cube with (when you run 0_data_preprocessing.py,
it can take time: 50 dialogs with 100 messages = 42 min, as it is made preprocessing there)
